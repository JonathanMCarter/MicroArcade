# Overview
The continuation of my university final major project (FMP), The idea was to have a project that would hold all the games I've made in a arcade game collection.

## The Original Aim
The aim of this project is to produce a custom arcade cabinet of my own and create a software product consisting of 2-3 game titles to go along with it, with the option to add more in the future. The games are made with the main intention of being played on the cabient firstly, porting to PC (keyboard) & gamepads will work but is not the initial intention for the project.

## The Games
These games were made with the intention of been playable on the custom arcade machine made for this project, hence they are all 2-player for the most part.
